# DevOps Learn Repository

This repository contains a collection of hands-on DevOps projects and deployment examples, demonstrating key concepts in containerization, orchestration, and cloud-native application management. Each folder represents a different scenario or technology stack, designed to learn and practice different DevOps tools.

## Repository Structure

- **1-simple-deploy/**: Basic Docker Compose deployment with Nginx reverse proxy.
- **2-simple-deploy-load-balancer/**: Docker Compose deployment with Nginx as a load balancer.
- **3-docker-swarm/**: Docker Swarm stack deployment with secrets management and Nginx reverse proxy.
- **4-simple-k8s/**: Simple Kubernetes deployment and service manifests for frontend and backend.
- **5-k8s-crud-app/**: Full CRUD application deployed on Kubernetes, including config maps, secrets, persistent volumes, and ingress.
- **shared/**: Contains reusable components and example applications (frontend, backend, reverse proxy) for Docker and Kubernetes demos.

## Applied Concepts 

- Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer
- Docker Swarm orchestration and secrets
- Kubernetes deployments, services, config maps, secrets, and persistent storage
- Building and deploying full-stack applications with Docker and Kubernetes

Each project folder contains its own README with setup instructions and details.
